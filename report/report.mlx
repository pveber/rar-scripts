\section{Determination of binding regions}
Each ChIP-seq sample yields a collection of peaks and it is not
straightforward to follow the time course of a single peak: one would
have to match peaks between samples (their position may vary, some may
appear/disappear, etc ...). Our approach is to use peaks from all
samples together to determine a fixed set of genomic regions where we
can detect binding events. These binding regions are considered as a
genomic feature (like genes) and do not depend on one particular
condition anymore, so one can study their coverage by sequencing data
across several conditions.

More formally, what we will thereafter call \emph{binding regions} are
the genomic locations defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item compute peaks with MACS for each sample, with a really
  permissive threshold
\item consider the set of positions on the genome which are the summit
  of a peak in at least one condition (MACS is pretty good at
  indicating the summit of a peak, it is shown in their paper that it
  is strongly correlated with the occurrence of the expected sequence
  motif)
\item define a link between any two summits that are closer to 100bp
\item compute connected components of this graph
\item define, for each connected component, a \emph{binding region},
  as a location of 500bp wide centered at the mean of the summits in
  the connected component
\end{enumerate}
